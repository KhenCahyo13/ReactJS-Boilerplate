## Explanation

Same like `components` folders, this one also came from ShadCN, and so we can utilize this. Usually I will utilize this folder for save an helper files, or maybe you often call it as `utils`?

```
- lib
    - utils.ts (it came from ShadCN too)
    - datetime.ts (datetime format helper)
    - ....(another helpers)
```
